# Joshua Noble's Tech Test
Welcome to the repository for my tech test for my application. In this repository you can find all the project files for my tech test, as well as the [justification](https://github.com/joenofriends/tech-test/blob/main/Justification.pdf) for my approach and a brief example of a [test plan](https://github.com/joenofriends/tech-test/blob/main/Test%20Plan.pdf) for the software. 

You can run the solution by cloning the repository, navigating to it and using the following commands:
```
cd tech-test
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

After that the server will be running and you can view my html interface for it at http://localhost:5204/

Thanks so much for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
